## [IIS] Restaurant IS

This project uses previous knowledge from IUS (Introduction to Software Engineering) and IDS (Database Systems). It takes the already created restaurant database and modifies it for the information system purpose. The information system itself was created for guest reservation and ordering or menu handling.

This information system was created as a team project with _Juraj Korƒçek (xkorce01)_.
